Occupation Description'!A1,ANZSCO Occupation codes and descriptions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Core competencies'!A1,"Core competencies are common to all jobs. They describe a set of non-specialist skills gained in early life and schooling and provide a base to further develop skills and specialties . Popular terms for these include ‘foundation skills’, ‘common skills’, ‘soft skills’, ‘core skills’ and ‘employability skills’. As part of the Australian Skills Classification work, the NSC identified 10 core competencies required for every occupation in Australia.  The core competencies align to the definitions of foundation skills typically used in the Australian VET system – specifically, the Employability Skills Framework developed by the Australian Skills Quality Authority, with minor differences recommended by education system experts. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Core competencies description'!A1,"Descriptions for each core competency, and the definition of each core competency anchor value. Different occupations can require different levels of core competencies. The Australian Skills Classification uses anchor values to show the level of competency for each of the core competencies relevant to the occupation. Anchor values show the importance of each competency to the occupation, and the definition gives context to the number value relative to the other values. Definitions are general and not specific to occupations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Specialist tasks'!A1,"The specialist tasks are designed to describe day- to -day work within an occupation, and are work activities a person undertakes specific to a job. While these skills can be transferrable across occupations and sectors, unlike core competencies, they are not universal. The Australian Skills Classification identifies specialist tasks for occupations in the Australian labour market in a way that allows these tasks to be compared across different occupations.

The skills clusters are clusters of similar specialist tasks. These tasks are considered to be broadly transferable – if you can do one task in the cluster, you can do the others. They show how skills are related and connected to one another, and illustrates the transferability of skills across occupations.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Technology tool'!A1,"Technology tools are a technology, such as software or hardware, that is used within an occupation. Common technology tools, (such as search engines and email,) are featured across most occupations, and these are captured in the core competency of digital engagement, rather than under this section. The remaining technology tools are highly specialised and occupation-specific.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Technology Tool examples'!A1,"For each technology tool, examples of that tool that are used in Australia are provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Common Technology Tools,"Several technology tools are so universal in 2021 that they are likely to be used by most or all occupations, and these are listed here. These tools are: Office suite software (email and calendar software, word processing software, spreadsheet software, presentation software, desktop publishing software), search engine software, information retrieval and query software, and operating system interfaces.

Rather than being individually listed against each occupation, these common technology tools were best represented through the Digital Engagement core competency. This has the effect of ensuring the remaining technology tools only refer to more specialised technologies that are likely to be meaningfully different between occupations. It also prevents exaggerated transferability between occupations when they share only common technology tools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
