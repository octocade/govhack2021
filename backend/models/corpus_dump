"I think Psych2Go's audience is very curious and open to new information. I think most of them want to connect with others and have a better understanding of themselves. I often see positive and supportive comments on videos and an audience that is trying to find people that go through the same things as them. As far as I've seen, the videos people are more interested in are those that deal"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology) LivingBobbyWelcome to my channel - LivingBobby!
